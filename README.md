# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-From-Scratch
End-to-End Implementation of a Fully Connected Neural Network for Fashion-MNIST Classification Without Deep Learning Frameworks

This project presents an end-to-end implementation of a fully connected neural network for Fashion-MNIST classification using only NumPy, without relying on any deep learning frameworks like
TensorFlow or PyTorch. By building each component from scratch—forward propagation, backpropagation, dropout, regularization, and optimizers—it offers a deep dive into how neural networks 
function under the hood. Fashion-MNIST, with its diverse set of 28×28 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories, serves as an ideal benchmark: more challenging than MNIST yet 
lightweight and accessible. The model achieves high accuracy, reinforcing both practical understanding and foundational knowledge of deep learning mechanics.
